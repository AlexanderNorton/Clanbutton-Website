# Clanbutton-Website
This was my first web development project that made use of HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP and SQL.
The Clanbutton allows gamers to find others to play games with. The user would search for any game (a dropdown menu with a list of suggestions is shown) and the player can then insert their details such as Steam or Origin info to get started. This was a quick personal project which I effectively used as means of learning web development and design.

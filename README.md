# Clanbutton-Website
Previously hosted at clanbutton.com, the Clanbutton allows gamers to find others to play games with. The user would search for any game (a dropdown menu with a list of suggestions is shown) and the player can then insert their details such as Steam or Origin info to get started. This was a quick personal project which I effectively used as means of learning web development and design. The project uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP for database connectivity. The project is incomplete; however I may continue to develop this alongside the Clanbutton mobile app in the future.
